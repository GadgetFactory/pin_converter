This is a document to collect some initial thoughts on what the PinConverter UI should offer.

-Concept of project file
 -Holds possibly one or more boards with zero or more wings placed on them
 -Holds a collection of imported/created boards and wings, beyond the provided defaults
-Open/Close/Save/Save As... project file
-Import/Export board definition file
-Import/Export wing definition file
-Create new board/wing
-Edit board/wing, pins, and constraints
-View/Export UCF file for board
-Set UCF options, possibly during export, or as properties of a board itself
-Colorized view of generated UCF

-Possible TreeView of boards with their bus children and pin grandchildren
-Select node, pane on right shows properties of node
-Pane may be tabbed view: Board, Wing, Bus, Pin. Then when a node is selected, that tab is automatically brought to front
