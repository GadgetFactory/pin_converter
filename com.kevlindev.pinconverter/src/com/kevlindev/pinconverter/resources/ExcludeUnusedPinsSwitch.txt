The exclude unused pins switch is used to remove any unassigned pins from a generated UCF file. This occurs when placing a wing on a board. Some wings have unassigned pins. By default, these unassigned pins are emitted to the UCF file, but they have a leading comment character, '#', so they are not active in the UCF file. If these entries are not desired, then use the exclude unused pins switch to prevent these entries from being emitted at all.
