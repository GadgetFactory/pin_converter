The collapse columns switch disables column formatting for what is referred to as the "additions" column. All constraints that follow the location (LOC) constraint are grouped together for formatting purposes. It is possible for that a single entry in the "additions" column will cause all other rows to have large amounts of whitespace before the final "comment" column. If this whitespace is not desired, then use the collapse columns switch to remove that whitespace, resulting in the "comment" column being shifted left.
