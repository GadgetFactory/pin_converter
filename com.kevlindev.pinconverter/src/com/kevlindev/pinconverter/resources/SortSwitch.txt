The sort switch is used to sort a generated UCF file by NET name. By default, a UCF is generated in the order that pins are specified in the board definition file. Alternately, the generate switch can be used to specify the order that pins and buses are emitted. However, there are times where it makes a UCF file easier to read if items are grouped together logically. Using the sort switch, like-named NET names will be near one another.
